**`qfastfs`** is the collection of filesystem functions used by
[`qdd`](https://npm.im/qdd) to do things very quickly.

> Note: `qfastfs` violates some norms of normal Node.js programming, by diving
into interals and performing other trickery. It shouldn't be taken as example
code to inspire your application or library.
